# openpyxl_cheatsheet
It's easy to use python to ingest data and spit out a nicely formatted and completed spreadhseet at the end, and this repository aims at showing you exactly how!! Snippets of code and demonstration to create excel spreadhseets.  As of creating this, this is limited to the Microsoft world, and this was not designed for other spreadhseet programs like Libreoffice Calc.  Future revions will likely care for these differences.

As I continue to use more of Openpyxl and find other fun things to add, I will add to this; it's my intent to use this as a "cheat sheet".

## Usage

Go to Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in, it's free! 

Go to the "GitHub" tab and type "mathewrtaylor/openpyxl_cheatsheet"

Pick the notebook and run it! :-)
